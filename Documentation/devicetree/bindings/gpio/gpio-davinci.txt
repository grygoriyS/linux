Davinci/Keystone General-Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) peripheral bindings

Davinci GPIO IP is composite device which has common Configuration
registers and set GPIO bank blocks with up to 32 GPIO lines per each.
Each GPIO line can be configured to generate irq. Two IRQ generation modes
can be supported (depend on SoC): banked irqs, unbanked irqs.
	banked irqs: one IRQ is assigned for 16 GPIO lines (up to 2 IRQ per bank)
	unbanked irqs: one IRQ is directly mapped to one GPIO line
				 (up to 32 IRQs only for bank 0)

The Davinci GPIO IP represented in DT as subtree of devices where root
node is GPIO controller and sub-nodes are GPIO banks.

Davinci GPIO controller

Required Properties:
- compatible: should be "ti,davinci-gpio","ti,keystone-gpio"
- reg:	Physical base address of the common Configuration registers and the
		size of mapped memory.
- #address-cells = <1>;
- #size-cells = <1>;
- ranges;

Optional properties:
- clocks:	phandle reference to the controller clock. Required only
			if clock tree data present in device tree.
			See clock-bindings.txt
- clock-names:	clock name. It has to be "aemif". Required only if clock
				tree data present in device tree, in another case don't
				use it.
				See clock-bindings.txt


Davinci GPIO bank

Required Properties:
- compatible: should be "ti,davinci-gpio-bank","ti,keystone-gpio-bank"
- reg:	Physical base address of GPIO bank registers and the
		size of mapped memory.
- gpio-controller:	Marks the device node as a gpio controller.
					see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/gpio/gpio.txt
- interrupt-parent:	phandle of the parent interrupt controller.
- interrupts:	Array of GPIO interrupt number. Only banked or unbanked IRQs are
				supported at a time.
- ti,ngpio: The number of GPIO pins supported.

Optional properties:
- ti,davinci-gpio-unbanked:	The number of GPIOs that have an individual interrupt
		 					line to processor. Unbanked GPIOs are unsupported if
		 					not present.

The GPIO bank also may acts as an interrupt controller if it's configured
to use banked irqs . It uses the default two cells specifier as described in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt.
