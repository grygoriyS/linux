TI SoC Ethernet Switch Controller Device Tree Bindings (new)
------------------------------------------------------

The 3-port switch gigabit ethernet subsystem provides ethernet packet
communication and can be configured as an ethernet switch. It provides the
gigabit media independent interface (GMII),reduced gigabit media
independent interface (RGMII), reduced media independent interface (RMII),
the management data input output (MDIO) for physical layer device (PHY)
management.

Required properties:
- compatible : be one of the below:
	  "ti,cpsw-switch" for backward compatible
	  "ti,am335x-cpsw-switch" for AM335x controllers
	  "ti,am4372-cpsw-switch" for AM437x controllers
	  "ti,dra7-cpsw-switch" for DRA7x controllers
- reg : physical base address and size of the CPSW module IO range
- ranges : shall contain the CPSW module IO range available for child devices
- clocks : should contain the CPSW functional clock
- clock-names : should be "fck"
	See bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt
- interrupts : should contain CPSW RX_THRESH, RX, TX, MISC interrupts
- interrupt-names : should contain "rx_thresh", "rx", "tx", "misc"
	See bindings/interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt

Optional properties:
- syscon : phandle to the system control device node which provides access to
	efuse IO range with MAC addresses

Required Sub-nodes:
- ethernet-ports : contains CPSW external ports descriptions
	Required properties:
	- #address-cells : Must be 1
	- #size-cells : Must be 0
	- reg : CPSW port number. Should be 1 or 2
	- phys : phandle on phy-gmii-sel PHY (see phy/ti-phy-gmii-sel.txt)
	- phy-mode : See [1]
	- phy-handle : See [1]

	Optional properties:
	- label : Describes the label associated with this port
	- ti,dual-emac-pvid : Specifies default PORT VID to be used to segregate
		ports. Default value - CPSW port number.
	- mac-address : See [1]
	- local-mac-address : See [1]

- mdio : CPSW MDIO bus block description
	- bus_freq : MDIO Bus frequency
	See bindings/net/mdio.txt and davinci-mdio.txt

- cpts : The Common Platform Time Sync (CPTS) module description
	- clocks : should contain the CPTS reference clock
	- clock-names : should be "cpts"
	See bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt

	Optional properties - all ports:
	- cpts_clock_mult : Numerator to convert input clock ticks into ns
	- cpts_clock_shift : Denominator to convert input clock ticks into ns
			  Mult and shift will be calculated basing on CPTS
			  rftclk frequency if both cpts_clock_shift and
			  cpts_clock_mult properties are not provided.
